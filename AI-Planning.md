The latest planners based on SAT rival (and often exceed) the performance of planners based on other search paradigms.

Reduction to SAT is a very successful approach to solving hard combinatorial problems in Artificial Intelligence and computer science in general. Most commonly, problem instances reduced to SAT are solved with a general-purpose SAT solver.

The reduction is parameterized by a horizon length $T \geq $. The value of each state variable $x \in X$ in each time point $t \in {0, . . . , T}$ is represented by a propositional variable x@t. For each action a and $t \in {0, . . . , T âˆ’ 1}$ we similarly have a propositional variable $a\@t$ indicating whether action $a$ is taken at $t$
